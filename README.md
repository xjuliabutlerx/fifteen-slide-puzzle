# fifteen-slide-puzzle
15-Cell Slide Puzzle is a fun game that anyone can play and the top 5 players are remembered on the leaderboard. Music, sound effects, and school spirit included!

This was the final project for my first college computer science course. I have a PDF file in the directory that describes more of its features and gives credit to the appropriate people for music and sound effects.

**Before launching the game, make sure you download the background music (2).** The files were too big for me to upload to GitHub directly. Link to background music here:
